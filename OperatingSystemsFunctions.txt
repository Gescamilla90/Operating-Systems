File Management is one of the most functional pieces of an operating system. Although there are many, the ability to manage files and organize items within an operating system allows the user to find exactly what they need. Operating systems help keep track of vital pieces of information and locations as to where they are. It also holds user information if there are multiple users for one device. 

Security: In an operating system security is essential. Many operating systems have built in abilities to help protect passwords. In addition to protecting passwords, security features such as username and login credentials help deter people from getting access to things on your devices. For a macOS there are fingerprint options instead of typing in a password or there is face recognition on other devices to help protect the contents on a desktop. 

Error Detection: This is a love hate relationship when it comes to proof reading. The ability for an operating system to detect spelling errors helps, but it simply corrects a word. It does not make an accurate choice as to which word to use. The system will not prompt the question of “do you want to use the word exercise or excise?” so proof reading is still 100% necessary. Some words autocorrect (immediately change), while others simple are underlines with a red squiggly line to indicate a grammatical error and the user must pick between a list of word that they could possibly be intending to write. This can prove to be a blessing and curse. This is helpful for many reasons however and has come a long way since the beginning of notepad or word processor.
